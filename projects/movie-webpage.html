            <p>For this project, we were required to make a movie page with the basic CSS and HTML we recently learned in class.<p>
            <p>During this project, I made a movie webpage with my partner (Caron) on replit using the basic knowledge of HTML and CSS that we already learned in Mr. Mueller's SEP class. </p>
            <p>My partner and I decided to make a movie webpage that was based on the mystery genre. We brainstormed various ideas and came up with a movie called "The Untold Flower Girl". The movie itself was about our-made character (Emily/Flower Girl), who was heavily loved and respected by her town, to suddenly go missing after giving out flowers like usual on her daily basis, and a crew was sent out to find her. Throughout this project, my partner and I worked on different components of the webpage. We tried to communicate with each other on occasions, and whenever there were problems, we would find ways to generate solutions together. </p>
            <p>Over the course of this project, my partner and I faced two main challenges. Surprisingly, one challenge was choosing a design scheme for our webpage. My partner and I were very cautious with choosing a design scheme because we knew it was correlated with the feeling that our webpage would portray. We wanted our theme to be light-dark/mysterious, so we ended up using two colors (#6D6665 and #878584) for our background. We also used the fonts "Nosifer", "Shadows Into Light", and "Black Ops One" to fit with our style. The other challenge my partner and I faced was gathering images that were relevant to our web page design. In the beginning, I thought gathering images was the easiest part of the project. But, I was wrong. Most of the licensable images on Google did not fit into our design and because of this, we created our own images using the logomakr website, which Mr. Mueller introduced to us.   </p>
