            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>The Freedom Project is a year-long work that requires us to conduct research and develop a prototype (a webpage). As for this, I worked alongside Jimmy, my peer, and used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Animate.css, and GitHub to construct a website. I also independently learned A-Frame as an additional tool. My webpage regards travel, and it includes a VR-scene that demonstrates a possiblity of future invention. The page also holds many cards that display technologies used in the industry.</p>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>The initial step for this project was to choose a specific topic to focus on. As for my decision, I decided to select Travel as my main focus given that the industry remains relevant in my life. Similarly, Jimmy also chose the same subject. As a result, we decided to pair up due to the common interest the both of us held.</p>

            <p>The coding portion was first held behind as we had to research our topic throughout the year. I researched hardware and software technologies that were relevant for traveling. However, I examined unpopular resorts to educate my audience about underdog tools that could impact and influence their lives. Jimmy repeated the same process. When we concluded our searching process, developing a prototype became the main priority. Jimmy and I developed several wireframes and ideas to demonstrate the overall looks of the webpage. </p>

            <p>For the most part, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS laid the foundation of my collaborative webpage. My peer and I both utilized Bootstrap cards, a vital component, to display most of our information, which also includes links and images and HTML div elements to organize our codes. To improve our website aesthetics and designs, CSS played a big role. We used various media queries along with properties to make our page stand out. We used Animate.css to give some content on the webpage an animation. Moreover, A-Frame was primarily applied to show my ideas (models) of future inventions, one particularly being a highly advanced portable charger. During this process we followed a format to develop a minimal viable product (a system that works at the bare minimum) before improving certain features later on. </p>

            <p>After developing a webpage, Jimmy and I had to deliver our message. We created presentation slides and showed various peers our webpage.</p>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>

            <p>Incorporating many tools into one webpage can lead to difficulties. Especially for A-Frame, creating a model was not as pleasant. As an alternative, I used Blender to sculpt a model and further downloaded the files and uploaded it into a A-Frame scene. This was more hefty since I also had to learn the basic concepts of Blender before developing a representation of my idea. On the other hand, Jimmy had to learn the animation topics. He spent various hours to learn how to apply such codes into the webpage as well as developing the outcome.</p>

            <h3>Takeaways</h3>

            <ul>
                <li style="font-size:0.8em">Creativity is an important skill to hold. The Freedom Project is based on our imagination. To develop a good-quality webpage, my peer and I had to first visualize our plans before learning such tools to make it become a reality. </li>
                <li style="font-size:0.8em">Effective research is essential when it comes to building a webpage. Jimmy and I had to find valuable content to display to our audiences, and by doing so, we needed an efficient way to gather information. One way we did this was instead of spending long amounts of time on a single source, both of us frequently moved to different links. Once we found desirable information, we jotted it down in our notes. This saved a surplus amount of time.</li>
