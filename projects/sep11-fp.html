            <h1 class="margin text-center">Freedom Project</h1>

            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p>Similar to SEP10 from last year, I spent another year making our Freedom Project. I partnered up with Kyle and conducted research on problems in society and developed a prototype using JavaScript to migitate the issue. For this project, I learned Kaboomjs with my partner to conduct an educational platformer game with multiple levels to help students academically and reduce doomscrolling and combat lower attention spans.</p>

            <h3>Process</h3>

            <p>Since we were given the freedom to make a product on any topic, I chose to make an educational game. I was able to pair up with Kyle because he had a similar interest as me.</p>

            <p>We researched our issue, focusing on the academic side. We found that doomscrolling caused lower attention rates in school, correlating with a lower academic performance in students. As for this issue, I created an idea with Kyle where we should create an engaging, educative game. It would drag users into the game while helping them learn without difficulty.</p>

            <!-- <p>We used Kaboom for the majority of our project. We followed the documentations and using various components such as scene, go function,  </p> -->

            <!-- <p></p> -->


            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            While I worked with Kyle throughout the project, we also delegated roles to maximize productivity. For example, I would work on creating separate levels while Kyle spent time making a start button and adding new sprites to the game. While splitting up tasks did increase productivity, it also made merging harder. Sometimes Kyle would add a new scene and a go function into the file and once we merged our work, an error would occur because of this. My code would have a completely different purpose than Kyle's. That is, the addition of new functions conflict with my code portion and I would have to add additional things to resolve such issues. We had to constantly tell each other our plan for the day so we could each do our individual tasks but also aim to make each work merges easier with less conflicts.



            <h3>Takeaways</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Keep communications clear especially in teamwork - Kyle and I updated each other regularly so we understood how we can merge each others work without conflicts</li>
                <li></li>
            </ul>
