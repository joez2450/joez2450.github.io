            <p>During this project, I made a movie webpage with my partner (Caron) on replit.com by using the basic knowledge of HTML and CSS that we already learned in Mr. Mueller's SEP class. </p>
            <p>My partner and I decided to make a movie webpage that was based on the mystery genre. We created a plot that involved our made character (Emily/Flower Girl), who was heavily loved by her town, go missing all of a sudden. Throughout this project, my partner and I worked on different componenets of the webpage. In order to accomplish our goal of making a mystery movie webpage, we were constantly working efficiently, </p>
            <p>Over the course of this project, my partner and I faced two main challenges. Surprisingly, one challenge was making a plot for our movie. My partner and I were frozen with making a storyline, however, Caron (my partner) eventually came up with the Flower Girl idea and we stuck with it. Another challenge my partner and I faced was gathering images that were relevant to our webpage design. In the beginning, I thought gathering images were the easiest part of the project. But, I was wrong. Most of the licensable images on google did not fit into our design and because of this, we created our own images using the logomakr website, which Mr. Mueller introduced to us.   </p>
