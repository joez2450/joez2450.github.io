            <h3>Context</h3>
            <p> The main goal behind this project was to create a webpage about a topic of Advanced Web Design and further demonstrate it toward the class. As for this task, I was working alongisde Caron and Dayanis on replit using the languages HTML and CSS. The main two skills that were involved included:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Collaboration</li>
                <li>Communication</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>Starting with the project, my peers and I formed a plan, as it is always a classic way to gain a better overview of the structure we plan to build. As our chosen topic, we focused on the "Basics" portion of AVD. The topic included text-align, height and width, strong, strikethrough horizontal line, background color, header size, underline, box-shadow, italics, and opacity, which had to be covered. We ended up choosing to split the large amount of concepts between three people (equal parts of HTML coding), ideally creating separate boxes for every new tags, and having everyone contribute to the CSS portion.</p>

            <p>Reaching the coding portion, my partners and I first created a new Repl. Afterward, we starting using header, paragraph, horizontal line, and div elements to create boxes for each code lines. We placed a large emphasis on our own parts, providing brief definitions and syntax of each tag, element, and CSS properties. We also decorated the webpage significantly to make the overall webpage look appealing to the audience. During all of this, my partners and I communicated, letting each other know of the sections to be done. This allowed us to work more efficiently and look forward.    </p>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>As our project came near to being finished, there were was a main challenge that I still needed to overcome. I specifically struggled to create an example of Box-Shadow. I had difficulties understanding the syntax for the specific concept. I wanted to create a light-black shadow toward my div element, however, it was onerous to do so.</p>

            <p>A solution my peers generated was to use a resourceful website - w3schools. I reviewed my misunderstanding thoroughly and generated this line of code in my CSS file, box-shadow {Box-Shadow: 0px 10px 20px 1px rgba(1,1,1,15.25); background-color: coral;}. I applied it to my div, and the obstacle was endured with help from my groupmates.</p>
            <h3>Takeaways</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Always take suggestions from others - they help you progress forward</li>
                <li>Plan ahead - it helps you work more proficiently benefitting the future</li>
            </ul>
